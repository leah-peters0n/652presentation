# Background Information

Column {data-width=350}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#### **What is this dashboard?**
This is my final project for EDLD 652 Data Visualization at the University of Oregon as part of a [Data Science Specialization](https://education.uoregon.edu/epol/specialization-educational-data-science). For this project, I created visualizations depicting data focused on food choices and eating habits.

#### **Where are these data from?**
These data came from the [Vegans and vegetarians have higher othorexic traits than omnivores and choose food for reasons including ethics and weight control](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Untitled_Item/21006490), which is an open-source, de-identified data set available for download. 

#### **Who made this dashboard?**
I did! I also had emotional support from my dog. Making data visualizations in RStudio is painful sometimes, so she really helped keeping morale up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **My Variables**


##### *Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ)*
This measure is evaluating the at the individual level what factors one uses to make food choices. Steptoe et al. (1995) developed the 36 item measure to include nine factors: health, mood, convenience, sensory appeal, natural content, price, weight control, familiarity, and ethical concerns. This measure allows us to systematically compare the importance of health related and non-health related food choice factors. 

##### *Eating Disorder (ED) History*
Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, have been linked to differences in diet types (Bardone-Cone et al., 2012) and individual food choices (Barthels et al., 2020). 
One eating disorder, orthorexia nervosa (ON), has recently been getting an increase of attention in the research community. [Orthorexia nervosa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6370446/) is an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. Those who are diagnosed with ON are obsessed with healthy eating in such a way that disrupts their daily life and involves restrictive actions regarding food.

##### *Highest Level of Education*
Higher educational attainment has been correlated with a healthier diet (Azizi Fard et al., 2021). In these data, there are four levels of education collected:

1. Did not graduate high school

2. Graduated high school

3. Associates degree or equivalent

4. Bachelors degree or higher

##### *Types of Dietary Practices* 
Dietary practices are defined by a participant’s preference in food consumption or behaviors of dietary habits. This sample has the following diets:

1. Pescatarian: Individuals who do not eat meat, but do eat seafood.

2. Omnivore: Individuals who eat meat, seafood, and plant-based foods.

3. Vegetarian: Individuals who do not eat meat.

4. Vegan: Individuals who do not eat meat or any animal derived food, such as eggs or dairy.

In the following visualizations, vegan and vegetarian dietary practices will be combined and omnivore diets will be split into three categories: plant-heavy omnivore, moderate omnivore (consumes an equal amount of plant based food and animal based foods), and animal-heavy omnivore.
